## The challenge

Build out single-page portfolio showcasing my current languages, future developing projects, and interests. Essentially an online one pager or resume. 

Your users should be able to:

- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Expected behavior

When the user clicks the "Contact me" call-to-action in the hero or projects section, the browser should scroll down to the contact form.


## My process

Workflow used to create portfolio project. 

1. Created a repo will making it easier to share and receive feedback regarding my code and project/portfolio to networking community. 
2. I look through the designs recommended by friend-end developer and web designer, APClark.  planning out how you'll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help you think ahead for CSS classes to create reusable styles.
3. Before adding any styles, structure your content with HTML. Writing your HTML first can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content.
4. Write out the base styles for your project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
5. Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section once you're happy you've completed the area you're working on.
